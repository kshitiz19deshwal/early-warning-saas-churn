\# Early-Warning SaaS Churn Prevention System



\## Business Problem

SaaS companies lose customers gradually when users disengage silently before canceling.

The objective of this project is to detect early behavioral decline using user event data

and proactively identify at-risk customers before churn happens.



\## Goal

Build a system that tracks customer behavior over time, detects behavioral drift,

classifies risk stages, and recommends retention actions.

## Approach

1\. Generated daily SaaS event-level data to simulate real user behavior

2\. Built customer behavior timelines from raw events

3\. Detected early behavioral drift signals

4\. Segmented customers into risk stages

5\. Trained a churn prediction model using drift features

6\. Recommended proactive retention actions



\## Key Features

\- Event-level SaaS data modeling

\- Behavioral drift detection (early warning)

\- Risk-based customer segmentation

\- Actionable churn prevention system



\## Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn



\## Business Impact
